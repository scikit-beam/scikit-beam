    cands : array
        Array of the indices in `x` (and `y`) for the candidate peaks.

    refine_function : function
        A function which takes a section of data with a peak in it and returns
        the location and height of the peak to sub-sample accuracy.  Additional
        parameters can be passed through via the refine_args kwarg.
